# Working with parameters on your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance<a name="Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Parameters"></a>

In some cases, you might create an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance without specifying a custom parameter group\. If so, your DB instance is created using the default parameter group for the version of PostgreSQL that you choose\. For example, suppose that you create an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance using PostgreSQL 13\.3\. In this case, the DB instance is created using the values in the parameter group for PostgreSQL 13 releases, `default.postgres13`\. 

You can also create your own custom DB parameter group\. You need to do this if you want to modify any settings for the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance from their default values\. To learn how, see [Working with parameter groups](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md)\. 

You can track the settings on your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance in several different ways\. You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API\. You can also query the values from the PostgreSQL `pg_settings` table of your instance, as shown following\. 

```
SELECT name, setting, boot_val, reset_val, unit
 FROM pg_settings
 ORDER BY name;
```

To learn more about the values returned from this query, see [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-settings.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-settings.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation\.

Be especially careful when changing the settings for `max_connections` and `shared_buffers` on your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance\. For example, suppose that you modify settings for `max_connections` or `shared_buffers` and you use values that are too high for your actual workload\. In this case, your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance won't start\. If this happens, you see an error such as the following in the `postgres.log`\.

```
2018-09-18 21:13:15 UTC::@:[8097]:FATAL:  could not map anonymous shared memory: Cannot allocate memory
2018-09-18 21:13:15 UTC::@:[8097]:HINT:  This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment
exceeded available memory or swap space. To reduce the request size (currently 3514134274048 bytes), reduce 
PostgreSQL's shared memory usage, perhaps by reducing shared_buffers or max_connections.
```

However, you can't change any values of the settings contained in the default RDS for PostgreSQL DB parameter groups\. To change settings for any parameters, first create a custom DB parameter group\. Then change the settings in that custom group, and then apply the custom parameter group to your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance\. To learn more, see [Working with parameter groups](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md)\. 

There are two types of RDS for PostgreSQL DB parameters\.
+ **Static parameters** – Static parameters require that the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance be rebooted after a change so that the new value can take effect\.
+ **Dynamic parameters** – Dynamic parameters don't require a reboot after changing their settings\.

**Note**  
If your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance is using your own custom DB parameter group, you can change the values of dynamic parameters on the running DB instance\. You can do this by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API\. 

If you have privileges to do so, you can also change parameter values by using the `ALTER DATABASE`, `ALTER ROLE`, and `SET` commands\. 

## RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance parameter list<a name="Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Parameters.parameters-list"></a>

The following table lists some \(but not all\) parameters available in an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance\. To view all available parameters, you use the [describe\-db\-parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-parameters.html) AWS CLI command\. For example, to get the list of all parameters available in the default parameter group for RDS for PostgreSQL version 13, run the following\.

```
aws rds describe-db-parameters --db-parameter-group-name default.postgres13
```

You can also use the Console\. Choose **Parameter groups** from the Amazon RDS menu, and then choose the parameter group from those available in your AWS Region\.

When you use the latest RDS for PostgreSQL versions, you have recent time zone data from RDS\. To ensure that your DB instance has recent time zone data, we recommend upgrading to a higher DB engine version\. You can't modify the time zone tables in PostgreSQL DB instances manually\.
