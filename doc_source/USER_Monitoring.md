# Viewing metrics in the Amazon RDS console<a name="USER_Monitoring"></a>

Amazon RDS integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to display a variety of RDS DB instance metrics in the RDS console\. For descriptions of these metrics, see [Metrics reference for Amazon RDS](metrics-reference.md)\.

For your DB instance, the following categories of metrics are monitored:
+ **CloudWatch** – Shows the Amazon CloudWatch metrics for RDS that you can access in the RDS console\. You can also access these metrics in the CloudWatch console\. Each metric includes a graph that shows the metric monitored over a specific time span\. For a list of CloudWatch metrics,  see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon RDS](rds-metrics.md)\.
+ **Enhanced monitoring** – Shows a summary of operating\-system metrics when your RDS DB instance has turned on Enhanced Monitoring\. RDS delivers the metrics from Enhanced Monitoring to your Amazon CloudWatch Logs account\. Each OS metric includes a graph showing the metric monitored over a specific time span\. For an overview, see [Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring.OS.md)\. For a list of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, see [OS metrics in Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring-Available-OS-Metrics.md)\.
+ **OS Process list** – Shows details for each process running in your DB instance\.
+ **Performance Insights** – Opens the Amazon RDS Performance Insights dashboard for a DB instance\. For an overview of Performance Insights, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon RDS](USER_PerfInsights.md)\. For a list of Performance Insights metrics, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Performance Insights](USER_PerfInsights.Cloudwatch.md)\.

Amazon RDS now provides a consolidated view of Performance Insights and CloudWatch metrics in the Performance Insights dashboard\. Performance Insights must be turned on for your DB instance to use this view\. You can choose the new monitoring view in the **Monitoring** tab or **Performance Insights** in the navigation pane\. To view the instructions for choosing this view, see [Viewing combined metrics in the Amazon RDS console](Viewing_Unifiedmetrics.md)\.

If you want to continue with the legacy monitoring view, continue with this procedure\.

**Note**  
The legacy monitoring view will be discontinued on December 15, 2023\.
