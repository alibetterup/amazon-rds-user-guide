# RDS Custom for Oracle workflow<a name="custom-concept.workflow"></a>

The following diagram shows the typical workflow for RDS Custom for Oracle\.

![\[RDS Custom for Oracle architecture components\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/./images/RDS_Custom_architecture_v2.png)

The steps are as follows:

1. Upload your database software to your Amazon S3 bucket\.

   For more information, see [Step 3: Upload your installation files to Amazon S3](custom-cev.preparing.md#custom-cev.preparing.s3)\.

1. Create an RDS Custom for Oracle custom engine version \(CEV\) from your media\.

   For more information, see [Creating a CEV](custom-cev.create.md)\.

1. Create an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance from a CEV\.

   For more information, see [Creating an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance](custom-creating.md#custom-creating.create)\.

1. Connect your application to the DB instance endpoint\.

   For more information, see [Connecting to your RDS Custom DB instance using SSH](custom-creating.md#custom-creating.ssh) and [Connecting to your RDS Custom DB instance using AWS Systems Manager](custom-creating.md#custom-creating.ssm)\.

1. \(Optional\) Access the host to customize your software\.

1. Monitor notifications and messages generated by RDS Custom automation\.

## Database installation files<a name="custom-concept.workflow.db-files"></a>

Your responsibility for media is a key difference between Amazon RDS and RDS Custom\. Amazon RDS, which is a fully managed service, supplies the Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) and database software\. The Amazon RDS database software is preinstalled, so you need only choose a database engine and version, and create your database\.

For RDS Custom, you supply your own media\. When you create a custom engine version, RDS Custom installs the media that you provide\. RDS Custom media contains your database installation files and patches\. This service model is called Bring Your Own Media \(BYOM\)\.

## Custom engine version<a name="custom-concept.workflow.cev"></a>

An RDS Custom custom engine version \(CEV\) is a binary volume snapshot of a database version and AMI\. By default, RDS Custom for Oracle uses the most recent AMI that Amazon EC2 makes available\. You can also choose to reuse an existing AMI\.

You store your database installation files in Amazon S3\. When you create your CEV, you specify the files in a JSON document called a CEV manifest\. You can also specify installation parameters that set nondefault values for the Oracle base, Oracle home, and the ID and name of the UNIX/Linux user and group\.

Name your CEV using a customer\-specified string\. The name format is the following, depending on your Oracle Database release:
+ `19.customized_string`
+ `18.customized_string`
+ `12.2.customized_string`
+ `12.1.customized_string`

You can use 1â€“50 alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, and periods\. For example, you might name your CEV `19.my_cev1`\. When you create a CEV, you can specify the Oracle Multitenant option\. You can create container databases \(CDBs\) only when the CEV was created with the Oracle Multitenant option\. For more information, see [Working with custom engine versions for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-cev.md)\.

## Creating a DB instance for RDS Custom for Oracle<a name="custom-concept.workflow.instance"></a>

After you create your CEV, it's available for use\. You can create multiple CEVs, and you can create multiple RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances from any CEV\. You can also change the status of a CEV to make it available or inactive\.

You can either create your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance with the Oracle Multitenant architecture \(`custom-oracle-ee-cdb` engine type\) or with the traditional non\-CDB architecture \(`custom-oracle-ee` engine type\)\. When you create a container database \(CDB\), it contains one pluggable database \(PDB\) and one PDB seed\. You can create additional PDBs manually using Oracle SQL\.

To create your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance, use the `create-db-instance` command\. In this command, specify which CEV to use\. The procedure is similar to creating an Amazon RDS DB instance\. However, some parameters are different\. For more information, see [Configuring a DB instance for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-creating.md)\.

## Database connection<a name="custom-concept.workflow.db-connection"></a>

Like an Amazon RDS DB instance, an RDS Custom DB instance resides in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. Your application connects to the Oracle database using an Oracle listener\.

If your database is a CDB, you can use the listener `L_RDSCDB_001` to connect to the CDB root and to a PDB\. If you plug a non\-CDB into a CDB, make sure to set `USE_SID_AS_SERVICE_LISTENER = ON` so that migrated applications keep the same settings\.

When you connect to a non\-CDB, the master user is the user for the non\-CDB\. When you connect to a CDB, the master user is the user for the PDB\. To connect to the CDB root, log in to the host, start a SQL client, and create an administrative user with SQL commands\. 

## RDS Custom customization<a name="custom-concept.workflow.db-customization"></a>

You can access the RDS Custom host to install or customize software\. To avoid conflicts between your changes and the RDS Custom automation, you can pause the automation for a specified period\. During this period, RDS Custom doesn't perform monitoring or instance recovery\. At the end of the period, RDS Custom resumes full automation\.
