# Connecting to a DB instance running the MySQL database engine<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance"></a>

 Before you can connect to a DB instance running the MySQL database engine, you must create a DB instance\. For information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](USER_CreateDBInstance.md)\. After Amazon RDS provisions your DB instance, you can use any standard MySQL client application or utility to connect to the instance\. In the connection string, you specify the DNS address from the DB instance endpoint as the host parameter, and specify the port number from the DB instance endpoint as the port parameter\. 

To authenticate to your RDS DB instance, you can use one of the authentication methods for MySQL and AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) database authentication:
+ To learn how to authenticate to MySQL using one of the authentication methods for MySQL, see [ Authentication method](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/authentication-method.html) in the MySQL documentation\.
+ To learn how to authenticate to MySQL using IAM database authentication, see [IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.md)\.

You can connect to a MySQL DB instance by using tools like the MySQL command\-line client\. For more information on using the MySQL command\-line client, see [mysql \- the MySQL command\-line client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) in the MySQL documentation\. One GUI\-based application you can use to connect is MySQL Workbench\. For more information, see the [Download MySQL Workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) page\. For information about installing MySQL \(including the MySQL command\-line client\), see [Installing and upgrading MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html)\. 

Most Linux distributions include the MariaDB client instead of the Oracle MySQL client\. To install the MySQL command\-line client on Amazon Linux 2023, run the following command:

```
sudo dnf install mariadb105
```

To install the MySQL command\-line client on Amazon Linux 2, run the following command:

```
sudo yum install mariadb
```

To install the MySQL command\-line client on most DEB\-based Linux distributions, run the following command:

```
apt-get install mariadb-client
```

To check the version of your MySQL command\-line client, run the following command:

```
mysql --version
```

To read the MySQL documentation for your current client version, run the following command:

```
man mysql
```

To connect to a DB instance from outside of its Amazon VPC, the DB instance must be publicly accessible, access must be granted using the inbound rules of the DB instance's security group, and other requirements must be met\. For more information, see [Can't connect to Amazon RDS DB instance](CHAP_Troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.Connecting)\.

You can use Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) or Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) encryption on connections to a MySQL DB instance\. For information, see [Using SSL/TLS with a MySQL DB instance](mysql-ssl-connections.md#MySQL.Concepts.SSLSupport)\. If you are using AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) database authentication, make sure to use an SSL/TLS connection\. For information, see [IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.md)\. 

You can also connect to a DB instance from a web server\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon RDS DB instance](TUT_WebAppWithRDS.md)\.

**Note**  
For information on connecting to a MariaDB DB instance, see [Connecting to a DB instance running the MariaDB database engine](USER_ConnectToMariaDBInstance.md)\.

## Finding the connection information for a MySQL DB instance<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.EndpointAndPort"></a>

The connection information for a DB instance includes its endpoint, port, and a valid database user, such as the master user\. For example, suppose that an endpoint value is `mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`\. In this case, the port value is `3306`, and the database user is `admin`\. Given this information, you specify the following values in a connection string:
+ For host or host name or DNS name, specify `mydb.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`\.
+ For port, specify `3306`\.
+ For user, specify `admin`\.

To connect to a DB instance, use any client for the MySQL DB engine\. For example, you might use the MySQL command\-line client or MySQL Workbench\.

To find the connection information for a DB instance, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI [describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) command, or the Amazon RDS API [DescribeDBInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html) operation to list its details\. 

### Console<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.EndpointAndPort.Console"></a>

**To find the connection information for a DB instance in the AWS Management Console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases** to display a list of your DB instances\.

1. Choose the name of the MySQL DB instance to display its details\.

1. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, copy the endpoint\. Also, note the port number\. You need both the endpoint and the port number to connect to the DB instance\.   
![\[The endpoint and port of a DB instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/endpoint-port.png)

1. If you need to find the master user name, choose the **Configuration** tab and view the **Master username** value\.

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.EndpointAndPort.CLI"></a>

To find the connection information for a MySQL DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the [describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) command\. In the call, query for the DB instance ID, endpoint, port, and master user name\.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances \
  --filters "Name=engine,Values=mysql" \
  --query "*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,Endpoint.Port,MasterUsername]"
```

For Windows:

```
aws rds describe-db-instances ^
  --filters "Name=engine,Values=mysql" ^
  --query "*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,Endpoint.Address,Endpoint.Port,MasterUsername]"
```

Your output should be similar to the following\.

```
[
    [
        "mydb1",
        "mydb1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        3306,
        "admin"
    ],
    [
        "mydb2",
        "mydb2.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
        3306,
        "admin"
    ]
]
```

### RDS API<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.EndpointAndPort.API"></a>

To find the connection information for a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [DescribeDBInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html) operation\. In the output, find the values for the endpoint address, endpoint port, and master user name\. 

## Connecting from the MySQL command\-line client \(unencrypted\)<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.CLI"></a>

**Important**  
Only use an unencrypted MySQL connection when the client and server are in the same VPC and the network is trusted\. For information about using encrypted connections, see [Connecting from the MySQL command\-line client with SSL/TLS \(encrypted\)](mysql-ssl-connections.md#USER_ConnectToInstanceSSL.CLI)\.

To connect to a DB instance using the MySQL command\-line client, enter the following command at the command prompt\. For the \-h parameter, substitute the DNS name \(endpoint\) for your DB instance\. For the \-P parameter, substitute the port for your DB instance\. For the \-u parameter, substitute the user name of a valid database user, such as the master user\. Enter the master user password when prompted\. 

```
mysql -h mysql–instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u mymasteruser -p
```

After you enter the password for the user, you should see output similar to the following\.

```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 9738
Server version: 8.0.23 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

## Connecting with the Amazon Web Services JDBC Driver for MySQL<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.JDBCDriverMySQL"></a>

The AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL is a client driver designed for RDS for MySQL\. By default, the driver has settings that are optimized for use with RDS for MySQL\. For more information about the driver and complete instructions for using it, see [the AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL GitHub repository](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-mysql-jdbc/)\.

The driver is drop\-in compatible with the MySQL Connector/J driver\. To install or upgrade your connector, replace the MySQL connector \.jar file \(located in the application CLASSPATH\) with the AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL \.jar file, and update the connection URL prefix from `jdbc:mysql://` to `jdbc:mysql:aws://`\.

The AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL supports IAM database authentication\. For more information, see [AWS IAM Database Authentication](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mysql-jdbc#aws-iam-database-authentication) in the AWS JDBC Driver for MySQL GitHub repository\. For more information about IAM database authentication, see [IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.md)\.

## Troubleshooting connections to your MySQL DB instance<a name="USER_ConnectToInstance.Troubleshooting"></a>

Two common causes of connection failures to a new DB instance are:
+ The DB instance was created using a security group that doesn't authorize connections from the device or Amazon EC2 instance where the MySQL application or utility is running\. The DB instance must have a VPC security group that authorizes the connections\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC VPCs and Amazon RDS](USER_VPC.md)\.

  You can add or edit an inbound rule in the security group\. For **Source**, choose **My IP**\. This allows access to the DB instance from the IP address detected in your browser\.
+ The DB instance was created using the default port of 3306, and your company has firewall rules blocking connections to that port from devices in your company network\. To fix this failure, recreate the instance with a different port\.

For more information on connection issues, see [Can't connect to Amazon RDS DB instance](CHAP_Troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.Connecting)\.
