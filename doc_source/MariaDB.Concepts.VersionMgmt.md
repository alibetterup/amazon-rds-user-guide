# MariaDB on Amazon RDS versions<a name="MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt"></a>

For MariaDB, version numbers are organized as version X\.Y\.Z\. In Amazon RDS terminology, X\.Y denotes the major version, and Z is the minor version number\. For Amazon RDS implementations, a version change is considered major if the major version number changes, for example going from version 10\.5 to 10\.6\. A version change is considered minor if only the minor version number changes, for example going from version 10\.6\.10 to 10\.6\.12\.

You can specify any currently supported MariaDB version when creating a new DB instance\. You can specify the major version \(such as MariaDB 10\.5\), and any supported minor version for the specified major version\. If no version is specified, Amazon RDS defaults to a supported version, typically the most recent version\. If a major version is specified but a minor version is not, Amazon RDS defaults to a recent release of the major version you have specified\. To see a list of supported versions, as well as defaults for newly created DB instances, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.html) AWS CLI command\.

For example, to list the supported engine versions for RDS for MariaDB, run the following CLI command:

```
aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --engine mariadb --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

The default MariaDB version might vary by AWS Region\. To create a DB instance with a specific minor version, specify the minor version during DB instance creation\. You can determine the default minor version for an AWS Region using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine mariadb --engine-version major-engine-version --region region --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

Replace *major\-engine\-version* with the major engine version, and replace *region* with the AWS Region\. For example, the following AWS CLI command returns the default MariaDB minor engine version for the 10\.5 major version and the US West \(Oregon\) AWS Region \(us\-west\-2\):

```
aws rds describe-db-engine-versions --default-only --engine mariadb --engine-version 10.5 --region us-west-2 --query "*[].{Engine:Engine,EngineVersion:EngineVersion}" --output text
```

RDS for MariaDB major versions remain available at least until community end of life for the corresponding community version\. You can use the following dates to plan your testing and upgrade cycles\. If Amazon extends support for an RDS for MariaDB version for longer than originally stated, we plan to update this table to reflect the later date\.
