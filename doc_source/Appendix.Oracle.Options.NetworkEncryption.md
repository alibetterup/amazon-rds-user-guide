# Oracle native network encryption<a name="Appendix.Oracle.Options.NetworkEncryption"></a>

Amazon RDS supports Oracle native network encryption \(NNE\)\. With native network encryption, you can encrypt data as it moves to and from a DB instance\. Amazon RDS supports NNE for all editions of Oracle Database\.

A detailed discussion of Oracle native network encryption is beyond the scope of this guide, but you should understand the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and key before you decide on a solution for your deployment\. For information about the algorithms and keys that are available through Oracle native network encryption, see [Configuring network data encryption](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/db/11g/r2/prod/security/network_encrypt/ntwrkencrypt.htm) in the Oracle documentation\. For more information about AWS security, see the [AWS security center](http://aws.amazon.com/security)\.

**Note**  
You can use Native Network Encryption or Secure Sockets Layer, but not both\. For more information, see [Oracle Secure Sockets Layer](Appendix.Oracle.Options.SSL.md)\. 

## NNE option settings<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.Options"></a>

You can specify encryption requirements on both the server and the client\. The DB instance can act as a client when, for example, it uses a database link to connect to another database\. You might want to avoid forcing encryption on the server side\. For example, you might not want to force all client communications to use encryption because the server requires it\. In this case, you can force encryption on the client side using the `SQLNET.*CLIENT` options\.

Amazon RDS supports the following settings for the NNE option\.

**Note**  
When you use commas to separate values for an option setting, don't put a space after the comma\.


****  

| Option setting | Valid values | Default values | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO_CLIENTS`  |  `TRUE`, `FALSE`  |  `TRUE`  |  The behavior of the server when a client using a non\-secure cipher attempts to connect to the database\. If `TRUE`, clients can connect even if they aren't patched with the July 2021 PSU\.  If the setting is `FALSE`, clients can connect to the database only when they are patched with the July 2021 PSU\. Before you set `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO_CLIENTS` to `FALSE`, make sure that the following conditions are met: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.Options.NetworkEncryption.html)  |

## Adding the NNE option<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.Add"></a>

The general process for adding the NNE option to a DB instance is the following: 

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option group\.

1. Add the option to the option group\.

1. Associate the option group with the DB instance\.

When the option group is active, NNE is active\. 

**To add the NNE option to a DB instance using the AWS Management Console**

1. For **Engine**, choose the Oracle edition that you want to use\. NNE is supported on all editions\. 

1. For **Major engine version**, choose the version of your DB instance\. 

   For more information, see [Creating an option group](USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create)\. 

1. Add the **NNE** option to the option group\. For more information about adding options, see [Adding an option to an option group](USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption)\.  
**Note**  
After you add the NNE option, you don't need to restart your DB instances\. As soon as the option group is active, NNE is active\. 

1. Apply the option group to a new or existing DB instance: 
   + For a new DB instance, you apply the option group when you launch the instance\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](USER_CreateDBInstance.md)\.
   + For an existing DB instance, you apply the option group by modifying the instance and attaching the new option group\. After you add the NNE option, you don't need to restart your DB instance\. As soon as the option group is active, NNE is active\. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md)\. 

## Setting NNE values in the sqlnet\.ora<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.Using"></a>

With Oracle native network encryption, you can set network encryption on the server side and client side\. The client is the computer used to connect to the DB instance\. You can specify the following client settings in the sqlnet\.ora: 
+ `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO`
+ `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO_CLIENTS`
+ `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_CLIENT`
+ `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT`
+ `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT`
+ `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT`

For information, see [Configuring network data encryption and integrity for Oracle servers and clients](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e40393/asoconfg.htm) in the Oracle documentation\.

Sometimes, the DB instance rejects a connection request from an application\. For example, a rejection can occur when the encryption algorithms on the client and on the server don't match\. To test Oracle native network encryption, add the following lines to the sqlnet\.ora file on the client: 

```
DIAG_ADR_ENABLED=off
TRACE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT=/tmp
TRACE_FILE_CLIENT=nettrace
TRACE_LEVEL_CLIENT=16
```

When a connection is attempted, the preceding lines generate a trace file on the client called `/tmp/nettrace*`\. The trace file contains information about the connection\. For more information about connection\-related issues when you are using Oracle Native Network Encryption, see [About negotiating encryption and integrity](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e40393/asoconfg.htm#autoId12) in the Oracle Database documentation\.

## Modifying NNE option settings<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.ModifySettings"></a>

After you enable NNE, you can modify its settings\. Currently, you can modify NNE option settings only with the AWS CLI or RDS API\. You can't use the console\. To learn how to modify option settings using the CLI, see [AWS CLI](USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.ModifyOption.CLI)\. For more information about each setting, see [NNE option settings](#Oracle.Options.NNE.Options)\. 

**Topics**
+ [Modifying CRYPTO\_CHECKSUM\_\* values](#Oracle.Options.NNE.ModifySettings.checksum)
+ [Modifying ALLOW\_WEAK\_CRYPTO\* settings](#Oracle.Options.NNE.ModifySettings.encryption)

### Modifying CRYPTO\_CHECKSUM\_\* values<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.ModifySettings.checksum"></a>

If you modify NNE option settings, make sure that the following option settings have at least one common cipher:
+ `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER`
+ `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT`

The following example shows a scenario in which you modify `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER`\. The configuration is valid because the `CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT` and `CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER` both use `SHA256`\.


| Option setting | Values before modification | Values after modification | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT`  |  `SHA256`, `SHA384`, `SHA512`  |  No change  | 
|  `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER`  |  `SHA256`, `SHA384`, `SHA512`, `SHA1`, `MD5`  | SHA1,MD5,SHA256 | 

For another example, assume that you want to modify `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER` from its default setting to `SHA1,MD5`\. In this case, make sure you set `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT` to `SHA1` or `MD5`\. These algorithms aren't included in the default values for `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT`\.

### Modifying ALLOW\_WEAK\_CRYPTO\* settings<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.ModifySettings.encryption"></a>

To set the `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO*` options from the default value to `FALSE`, make sure that the following conditions are met:
+ `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT` have one matching secure encryption method\. A method is considered secure if it's not `DES`, `3DES`, or `RC4` \(all key lengths\)\.
+ `SQLNET.CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER` and `SQLNET.CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT` have one matching secure checksumming method\. A method is considered secure if it's not `MD5`\.
+ The client is patched with the July 2021 PSU\. If the client isn't patched, the client loses the connection and receives the `ORA-12269` error\.

The following example shows sample NNE settings\. Assume that you want to set `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT` to FALSE, thereby blocking non\-secure connections\. The checksum option settings meet the prerequisites because they both have `SHA256`\. However, `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER` use the `DES`, `3DES`, and `RC4` encryption methods, which are non\-secure\. Therefore, to set the `SQLNET.ALLOW_WEAK_CRYPTO*` options to `FALSE`, first set `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER` and `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT` to a secure encryption method such as `AES256`\.


| Option setting | Values | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT`  |  `SHA256`, `SHA384`, `SHA512`  | 
|  `SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER`  | SHA1,MD5,SHA256 | 
|  `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT`  |  `RC4_256`, `3DES168`, `DES40`  | 
|  `SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER`  |  `RC4_256`, `3DES168`, `DES40`  | 

## Removing the NNE option<a name="Oracle.Options.NNE.Remove"></a>

You can remove NNE from a DB instance\. 

To remove NNE from a DB instance, do one of the following: 
+ To remove NNE from multiple DB instances, remove the NNE option from the option group they belong to\. This change affects all DB instances that use the option group\. After you remove the NNE option, you don't need to restart your DB instances\. For more information, see [Removing an option from an option group](USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption)\. 
+ To remove NNE from a single DB instance, modify the DB instance and specify a different option group that doesn't include the NNE option\. You can specify the default \(empty\) option group, or a different custom option group\. After you remove the NNE option, you don't need to restart your DB instance\. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md)\.
