## Overview of managing master user passwords with AWS Secrets Manager<a name="rds-secrets-manager-overview"></a>

With AWS Secrets Manager, you can replace hard\-coded credentials in your code, including database passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically\. For more information about Secrets Manager, see [AWS Secrets Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/)\.

You can specify that RDS manages the master user password in Secrets Manager for an Amazon RDS DB instance or Multi\-AZ DB cluster when you perform one of the following operations:
+ Create the DB instance
+ Create the Multi\-AZ DB cluster
+ Modify the DB instance
+ Modify the Multi\-AZ DB cluster
+ Restore the DB instance from Amazon S3

When you specify that RDS manages the master user password in Secrets Manager, RDS generates the password and stores it in Secrets Manager\. You can interact directly with the secret to retrieve the credentials for the master user\. You can also specify a customer managed key to encrypt the secret, or use the KMS key that is provided by Secrets Manager\.

RDS manages the settings for the secret and rotates the secret every seven days by default\. You can modify some of the settings, such as the rotation schedule\. If you delete a DB instance that manages a secret in Secrets Manager, the secret and its associated metadata are also deleted\.

To connect to a DB instance or Multi\-AZ DB cluster with the credentials in a secret, you can retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager\. For more information, see [ Retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets.html) and [Connect to a SQL database with credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets_jdbc.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\.

## Benefits of managing master user passwords with Secrets Manager<a name="rds-secrets-manager-benefits"></a>

Managing RDS master user passwords with Secrets Manager provides the following benefits:
+ RDS automatically generates database credentials\.
+ RDS automatically stores and manages database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager\.
+ RDS rotates database credentials regularly, without requiring application changes\.
+ Secrets Manager secures database credentials from human access and plain text view\.
+ Secrets Manager allows retrieval of database credentials in secrets for database connections\.
+ Secrets Manager allows fine\-grained control of access to database credentials in secrets using IAM\.
+ You can optionally separate database encryption from credentials encryption with different KMS keys\.
+ You can eliminate manual management and rotation of database credentials\.
+ You can monitor database credentials easily with AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch\.

For more information about the benefits of Secrets Manager, see [AWS Secrets Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/)\.

## Permissions required for Secrets Manager integration<a name="rds-secrets-manager-permissions"></a>

Users must have the required permissions to perform operations related to Secrets Manager integration\. You can create IAM policies that grant permissions to perform specific API operations on the specified resources they need\. You can then attach those policies to the IAM permission sets or roles that require those permissions\. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon RDS](UsingWithRDS.IAM.md)\.

For create, modify, or restore operations, the user who specifies that Amazon RDS manages the master user password in Secrets Manager must have permissions to perform the following operations:
+ `kms:DescribeKey`
+ `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`
+ `secretsmanager:TagResource`

For create, modify, or restore operations, the user who specifies the customer managed key to encrypt the secret in Secrets Manager must have permissions to perform the following operations:
+ `kms:Decrypt`
+ `kms:GenerateDataKey`
+ `kms:CreateGrant`

For modify operations, the user who rotates the master user password in Secrets Manager must have permissions to perform the following operation:
+ `secretsmanager:RotateSecret`

## Enforcing RDS management of the master user password in AWS Secrets Manager<a name="rds-secrets-manager-auth"></a>

You can use IAM condition keys to enforce RDS management of the master user password in AWS Secrets Manager\. The following policy doesn't allow users to create or restore DB instances or DB clusters unless the master user password is managed by RDS in Secrets Manager\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": ["rds:CreateDBInstance", "rds:CreateDBCluster", "rds:RestoreDBInstanceFromS3", "rds:RestoreDBClusterFromS3"],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "rds:ManageMasterUserPassword": false
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note**  
This policy enforces password management in AWS Secrets Manager at creation\. However, you can still disable Secrets Manager integration and manually set a master password by modifying the instance\.  
To prevent this, include `rds:ModifyDBInstance`, `rds:ModifyDBCluster` in the Action block of the policy\. Be aware, this prevents the user from applying any further modifications to existing instances which do not have Secrets Manager integration enabled\. 

For more information about using condition keys in IAM policies, see [Policy condition keys for Amazon RDS](security_iam_service-with-iam.md#UsingWithRDS.IAM.Conditions) and [Example policies: Using condition keys](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#UsingWithRDS.IAM.Conditions.Examples)\.

## Managing the master user password for a DB instance with Secrets Manager<a name="rds-secrets-manager-db-instance"></a>

You can configure RDS management of the master user password in Secrets Manager when you perform the following actions:
+ [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](USER_CreateDBInstance.md)
+ [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md)
+ [Restoring a backup into a MySQL DB instance](MySQL.Procedural.Importing.md)

You can use the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API to perform these actions\.

### Console<a name="rds-secrets-manager-db-instance-console"></a>

Follow the instructions for creating or modifying a DB instance with the RDS console:
+ [Creating a DB instance](USER_CreateDBInstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating)
+ [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md)
+ [Importing data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance](MySQL.Procedural.Importing.md#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.PerformingImport)

When you use the RDS console to perform one of these operations, you can specify that the master user password is managed by RDS in Secrets Manager\. To do so when you are creating or restoring a DB instance, select **Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager** in **Credential settings**\. When you are modifying a DB instance, select **Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager** in **Settings**\.

The following image is an example of the **Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager** setting when you are creating or restoring a DB instance\.

![\[Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-credential-settings-db-instance.png)

When you select this option, RDS generates the master user password and manages it throughout its lifecycle in Secrets Manager\.

![\[Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager selected\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-create-db-instance.png)

You can choose to encrypt the secret with a KMS key that Secrets Manager provides or with a customer managed key that you create\. After RDS is managing the database credentials for a DB instance, you can't change the KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret\.

You can choose other settings to meet your requirements\. For more information about the available settings when you are creating a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](USER_CreateDBInstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings)\. For more information about the available settings when you are modifying a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md#USER_ModifyInstance.Settings)\.

### AWS CLI<a name="rds-secrets-manager-db-instance-cli"></a>

To manage the master user password with RDS in Secrets Manager, specify the `--manage-master-user-password` option in one of the following AWS CLI commands:
+ [create\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html)
+ [modify\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html)
+ [restore\-db\-instance\-from\-s3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-s3.html)

When you specify the `--manage-master-user-password` option in these commands, RDS generates the master user password and manages it throughout its lifecycle in Secrets Manager\.

To encrypt the secret, you can specify a customer managed key or use the default KMS key that is provided by Secrets Manager\. Use the `--master-user-secret-kms-key-id` option to specify a customer managed key\. The AWS KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key\. To use a KMS key in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN\. After RDS is managing the database credentials for a DB instance, you can't change the KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret\.

You can choose other settings to meet your requirements\. For more information about the available settings when you are creating a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](USER_CreateDBInstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Settings)\. For more information about the available settings when you are modifying a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md#USER_ModifyInstance.Settings)\.

This example creates a DB instance and specifies that RDS manages the master user password in Secrets Manager\. The secret is encrypted using the KMS key that is provided by Secrets Manager\.

## Viewing the details about a secret for a DB instance<a name="rds-secrets-manager-view-db-instance"></a>

You can retrieve your secrets using the console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)\) or the AWS CLI \([get\-secret\-value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-secret-value.html) Secrets Manager command\)\.

You can find the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager with the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

### Console<a name="rds-secrets-manager-view-db-instance-console"></a>

**To view the details about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose the name of the DB instance to show its details\.

1. Choose the **Configuration** tab\.

   In **Master Credentials ARN**, you can view the secret ARN\.  
![\[View the details about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-view-instance.png)

   You can follow the **Manage in Secrets Manager** link to view and manage the secret in the Secrets Manager console\.

### AWS CLI<a name="rds-secrets-manager-view-db-instance-cli"></a>

You can use the [describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) RDS CLI command to find the following information about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager:
+ `SecretArn` – The ARN of the secret
+ `SecretStatus` – The status of the secret

  The possible status values include the following:
  + `creating` – The secret is being created\.
  + `active` – The secret is available for normal use and rotation\.
  + `rotating` – The secret is being rotated\.
  + `impaired` – The secret can be used to access database credentials, but it can't be rotated\. A secret might have this status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS can no longer access the secret or the KMS key for the secret\.

    When a secret has this status, you can correct the condition that caused the status\. If you correct the condition that caused status, the status remains `impaired` until the next rotation\. Alternatively, you can modify the DB instance to turn off automatic management of database credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to turn on automatic management of database credentials\. To modify the DB instance, use the `--manage-master-user-password` option in the [modify\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) command\.
+ `KmsKeyId` – The ARN of the KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret

Specify the `--db-instance-identifier` option to show output for a specific DB instance\. This example shows the output for a secret that is used by a DB instance\.

**Example**  

```
1. aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance
```
Following is sample output for a secret:  

```
"MasterUserSecret": {
                "SecretArn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:rds!db-033d7456-2c96-450d-9d48-f5de3025e51c-xmJRDx",
                "SecretStatus": "active",
                "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:123456789012:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
            }
```

When you have the secret ARN, you can view details about the secret using the [get\-secret\-value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-secret-value.html) Secrets Manager CLI command\.

This example shows the details for the secret in the previous sample output\.

**Example**  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
    --secret-id 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:rds!db-033d7456-2c96-450d-9d48-f5de3025e51c-xmJRDx'
```
For Windows:  

```
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value ^
    --secret-id 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:rds!db-033d7456-2c96-450d-9d48-f5de3025e51c-xmJRDx'

You can view the ARN, status, and KMS key for a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager by using the [DescribeDBInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html) operation and setting the `DBInstanceIdentifier` parameter to a DB instance identifier\. Details about the secret are included in the output\.

When you have the secret ARN, you can view details about the secret using the [GetSecretValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html) Secrets Manager operation\.

## Viewing the details about a secret for a Multi\-AZ DB cluster<a name="rds-secrets-manager-view-db-cluster"></a>

You can retrieve your secrets using the console \([https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/)\) or the AWS CLI \([get\-secret\-value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-secret-value.html) Secrets Manager command\)\.

You can find the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager with the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

### Console<a name="rds-secrets-manager-view-db-cluster-console"></a>

**To view the details about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose the name of the Multi\-AZ DB cluster to show its details\.

1. Choose the **Configuration** tab\.

   In **Master Credentials ARN**, you can view the secret ARN\.  
![\[View the details about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-view-taz-cluster.png)

   You can follow the **Manage in Secrets Manager** link to view and manage the secret in the Secrets Manager console\.

### AWS CLI<a name="rds-secrets-manager-view-db-instance-cli"></a>

You can use the RDS AWS CLI [describe\-db\-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.html) command to find the following information about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager:
+ `SecretArn` – The ARN of the secret
+ `SecretStatus` – The status of the secret

  The possible status values include the following:
  + `creating` – The secret is being created\.
  + `active` – The secret is available for normal use and rotation\.
  + `rotating` – The secret is being rotated\.
  + `impaired` – The secret can be used to access database credentials, but it can't be rotated\. A secret might have this status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS can no longer access the secret or the KMS key for the secret\.

    When a secret has this status, you can correct the condition that caused the status\. If you correct the condition that caused status, the status remains `impaired` until the next rotation\. Alternatively, you can modify the DB cluster to turn off automatic management of database credentials, and then modify the DB cluster again to turn on automatic management of database credentials\. To modify the DB cluster, use the `--manage-master-user-password` option in the [modify\-db\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html) command\.
+ `KmsKeyId` – The ARN of the KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret

Specify the `--db-cluster-identifier` option to show output for a specific DB cluster\. This example shows the output for a secret that is used by a DB cluster\.

**Example**  

```
1. aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster
```
The following sample shows the output for a secret:  

```
"MasterUserSecret": {
                "SecretArn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:rds!cluster-033d7456-2c96-450d-9d48-f5de3025e51c-xmJRDx",
                "SecretStatus": "active",
                "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:123456789012:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
            }
```

When you have the secret ARN, you can view details about the secret using the [get\-secret\-value](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-secret-value.html) Secrets Manager CLI command\.

This example shows the details for the secret in the previous sample output\.

**Example**  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
    --secret-id 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:rds!cluster-033d7456-2c96-450d-9d48-f5de3025e51c-xmJRDx'
```
For Windows:  

```
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value ^
    --secret-id 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-1:123456789012:secret:rds!cluster-033d7456-2c96-450d-9d48-f5de3025e51c-xmJRDx'
```
